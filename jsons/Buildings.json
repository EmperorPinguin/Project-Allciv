It was disguised as a dance to avoid detection and was used to maintain cultural identity and freedom. Capoeira has since evolved into a significant cultural symbol of Brazil, representing resilience, creativity, and the fight against oppression. Today, it is practiced worldwide and is recognized as an important part of Brazilian cultural heritage."}],
